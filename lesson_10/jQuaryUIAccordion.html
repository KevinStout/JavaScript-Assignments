                I grew up racing motocross and have never lost interest in the sport. My passion at the moment is surfing,
                although im not very good at it. I love getting out on a good set of dirt jumps or even trail riding with friends.
                Days off are spent at the dam wake boarding or trying hit a golf ball as hard as possible.

            Danny MacAskill is a Scottish street trials pro rider for Inspired Bicycles Ltd, born and raised in Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye.
            On April 19th, 2009 the then twenty-three year old released a five-and-a-half-minute street trials video on YouTube set to ‘The Funeral’
            by Band of Horses that was to change his life. Filmed by his flatmate Dave Sowerby, the video got a few hundred thousand views over 
            night and  as of today has been watched well over 20 million times – the world went crazy for Danny. The video features stunts performed by MacAskill. 
        </p>

            Since the video went live, things progressed really fast; Danny found himself featured in the New York Times, joined a Hollywood production as a stunt man, 
            appeared in a TV-commercial for the new Volkswagen Golf Estate and was nominated for the Action Sportsperson of the Year Category of the Laureus World Sports Awards. 
            He eventually gave up his job as a mechanic so he could ride full time and now lives in Edinburgh.

            Once again shot by Dave Sowerby, Danny released a new video “Way Back Home” produced by Red Bull Media House that shows him revisiting 
            his roots on a trip back to his hometown Dunvegan the way he knows best – with the sickest riding far and wide. Only one week later, 
            a film Danny shot with his clothing partner Dig Deep in London hit the web, as usual dropping jaws all over the world.
