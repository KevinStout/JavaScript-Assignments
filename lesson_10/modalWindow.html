            At only 20 years old, Rach became the first British woman to win the Elite Women UCI Downhill World 
            Championship in June 2008 with an unprecendeted winning margin of 12 seconds. The same year she wrapped 
            up the World Cup Series. Since then she has gone on to win numerous UCI Downhill World Cups and Medals 
            at the World Champs, but injuries have prevented her from defending those titles...the game is now on!
